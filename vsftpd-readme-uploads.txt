Create a subdirectory with a relevant name in this uploads ftp directory (mkdir <mysubdir>).
Change to that subdirectory (cd <mysubdir>), set the transfer to binary (bin)
and copy the files over (mput).
Use the `prompt` command to turn off queries during mput.

Please let Evert Rol, e.rol@esciencecenter.nl, know when you're done copying,
and what the estimated amount of data copied is.
This will allow us to move the data onto the server in the appropriate directories.
