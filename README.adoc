# Ansible playbook for EUCP notebook server

This directory contains the Ansible playbook to set up a virtual
machine (VM) with a JupyterHub, for use within the EUCP. The VM tested
has been a Ubuntu 18.04 (LTS) system. The current setup uses one
running in the SURF HPC cloud.

Run as follows:

    ansible-playbook hpccloud-playbook.yml

Note that the `ansible.cfg` template file in this repository directory
points to the Ansible inventory, or specifically, the `hosts` file (a
template file is given in this directory), which sets the host(s) to
run the installation on. Update `hosts` as necessary for your
situation; you can use host aliases defined in your $HOME/.ssh/config
file.


Running the playbook performs the following steps:

* Installation of some standard (Ubuntu) packages
* Creation and mounting of data storage virtual disks
* Downloading and installation of MiniConda
** Installation of JupyterHub, JupyterLab and a few extensions (for
   Python version 3.6)
* Setup running for JupyterHub under a separate account
** Sudo access for JupyterHub group to spawn a JupyterLab for each
   account
** Systemd setup for JupyterHub
* Creation of user accounts with random passwords

## Data disks

The creation and mounting of data storage uses an Ansible variable
file, `mount_vars.yml`, to match devices and mount points. Every
device is xfs formatted and mounted under `/mnt/data/<dir>/`. Create
the `mount_vars.yml` file from the `mount_vars_template.yml` template.
If you don't need any data disks mounted, provide an empty list:

    mounts: []


## User accounts

The Ansible playbook can automatically create users with a random
password and with the correct groups. The user name and corresponding
main group are listed in the `user_vars.yml` file as a list of
mappings. Copy the `user_vars_template.yml` to `user_vars.yml` and
edit it accordingly. If you don't need any users right now, make the
`users` variable an empty list:

    users: []

Note: when adding users yourself, make sure that their (secondary)
groups are `users` and `jupyterhub`, otherwise new users will not be
able to start a JupyterLab.
